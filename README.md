# Simon Says: The Memory Game

Welcome to Simon Says, the classic memory game implemented using web technologies. Test your memory and see how long you can follow the ever-growing sequence!

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need the following:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. If you haven't installed Node.js yet, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Follow these steps to set up the game:

1. Clone this repository or download the zip file.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install` if using yarn) to install the project's dependencies.
4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the game!

## Gameplay

The game will generate a random sequence of colored buttons. Your objective is to remember and repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order. Each successful completion of a sequence will result in a new color being added, making the sequence longer. However, if you click the wrong button, the game will end, and your score will be displayed.
